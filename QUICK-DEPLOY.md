php artisan key:generate --show
```
Copy the output (starts with `base64:`) and add to environment variables.

### "Database error"
Make sure environment variable is: `DB_CONNECTION=sqlite`

### "502 Bad Gateway"
Wait 2-3 minutes after deployment. The server is still starting.

### "Application error"
Check logs in platform dashboard. Usually a missing environment variable.
